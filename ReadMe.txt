Hello Guys. I am FirstName.
I was a student member of the Thalir Innovation Fest 2023 competion. Specifically the design thinking division.
I was responsible for the circuit, and code of the hardware and the Full Stack Development of the Software.
Our project was nominated for the finals and later went on to win First Place in the Nationals. (School : Yuvabharathi)

Brief Explanation of the Model : 
  Problem Statement (Paraphrased) : An inovative solution to make public toilets more hygenic and safe to use.
  Our solution : An automated toilet kit that can be fitted in public toilets that cleans the toilet without human intervention

  Aspects of the Project : 
    1. The Hardware : Consists of an arduino circuit with servos pumps and leds. Handles automatic door locking unlocking and closing,
      toilet seat rearrangement, flushing, floor cleaning, and periodic recyling of used grey water.

    2. The Software : A website with a Leaflet map with dynamic markers of nearby toilets with their live status (Vacant -> Green, Occupied -> Red), done with raspberry pi connected to the toilets.
                      The website further allows bulk booking usefull for travell buses to book hygenic toilets for their travellers.
                      This is also useful for individual users travelling in remote areas where hotels and toilet fecilities are not common.
                      Other features include a Fast-Tag like credit system with auto subtraction of credits, and a Past booking page with taggable location for rebooking.

I was responsible for the circuit building, the Arduino Mega code for handling the circuit, the raspberry pi code with live access to the database , on the hardware side,
and the Full Stack (Front end, Middle Tyer, Backend) Creation for the website.

One intresting side product of this is that, the website code can almost be fully reused for other very usefull projects like Car Parking Booking Systems.

I will be posting my contribution to the project in this repositry for educational purposes. Enjoy and Stay Sharp.

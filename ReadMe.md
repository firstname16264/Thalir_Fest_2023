## Project Overview üöΩ

**Problem Statement (Paraphrased):** Develop a groundbreaking solution to make public toilets more hygienic and safe.

**Our Solution:** An automated toilet kit designed for public toilets, eliminating the need for human intervention in the cleaning process.

### Aspects of the Project üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Hardware Component:**
   - Arduino circuit featuring servos, pumps, and LEDs.
   - Automated functionalities: door locking/unlocking, toilet seat rearrangement, flushing, floor cleaning, and recycling of used gray water.

2. **Software Component:**
   - Web application with a dynamic Leaflet map showcasing nearby toilets and their live status (Vacant -> Green, Occupied -> Red) via Raspberry Pi.
   - Bulk booking system for individual users and travel buses, ensuring access to hygienic toilets in remote areas.

## Web App Features üåê

1. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Live status of nearby toilets on a to-scale map with dynamic markers (Vacant -> Green, Occupied -> Red).

2. **Pre-Booking Systems:**
   - Individual or bulk bookings with flexible timing options and easy cancellation.

3. **Fast Tag Credit System:**
   - Purchase credits in bulk to streamline restroom usage payments.

4. **Past Bookings Page:**
   - Track usage history, including credits spent, remaining balance, location, and time of bookings.

5. **Location Tagging System:**
   - Tag locations with custom text for easy search and reference in the Past Bookings page.

6. **QR System:**
   - Authenticate bookers at the physical location for added security.

## My Contributions üõ†Ô∏è

I was responsible for:
- Circuit building and Arduino Mega code for hardware functionalities.
- Raspberry Pi code for live database access.
- Full Stack development of the website (Front end, Middle Tier, Backend).

**Excitingly, the website code is versatile and can be repurposed for projects like Car Parking Booking Systems. Check out my contributions in the repository for educational purposes. Enjoy exploring, and stay sharp!**

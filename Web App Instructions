Web App Demo :
  To test out the website yourself, go to http://iunderstandit.in/index.php. Its safe, I promise. Your brower might say that its unsafe
because I don't have an SSL Cirtificate for the website, which can cost a monthly fee. Before using the app, you need to go to
chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure if you are using chrome and paste 'http://www.iunderstandit.in,http://iunderstandit.in'
into the input field and toggle the Disable button to Enable and relode chrome. Otherwise the website won't be allowed to ask for
your loacation permition which, as you can imagine is crutial to a website whose main feature is a Dynamic Map.
